- screw driver (for M3 screws)
- soldering equipment

## Required materials

- **Ã˜ 160/154 mm** acrylic tube, 25cm long (if you prefer vibrant colors and bright light: frosted. If you prefer seeing no single LED: white)
- **min. 260ml** of 3D printing resin (or similar amount of filament, if you use an FDM printer)
- **1x 25.6cm** aluminium square tube, 11.5x11.5mm
- **1m** WS2812B or WS2812B Eco LED strip, 60 LEDs/meter, white PCB
- **1x** USB-C female connector JRC-B008
- **1x** ESP32 D1 Mini
- **1x** MAX4466 microphone
- **3x** WAGO 221-415 connector
- **3x** WAGO 221-413 connector
- **3x** M3 nuts
- **3x** M3 8mm screws flat head
- wires (ideally in red, white or black, green)
- heat resistant tape
- optional: **2x** additional M3 nuts
- optional: **2x** M3 20mm screws flat head
- optional: **4x** 22mm felt gliders

## How to build the GlowLight

Let's start by cutting the LED strip into 14 LEDs long strips.

Now solder wires to the beginning of each LED strip - start with a 10cm long wire for each GND, V and D pin. You can shorten them later.

Next, lets tape the LED strips on the aluminium tube, in the middle of each of the four sides. To make sure they don't fall off after a while, wrap around some heat resistant tape in between the LEDs, to fix the LED strip to the aluminium tube. Do this at least on both ends and around the middle of the aluminum tube.
